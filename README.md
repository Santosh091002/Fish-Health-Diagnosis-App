# Fish Health Diagnosis: A Deep learning-based Fish Disease Detection Using CNN
Fish diseases spread like wildfire, affecting entire farms overnight. The main culprits of fish diseases
are Bacterial infections, Parasitic infestations and Viral diseases, if these are not detected in early
stages and if we do not take quick actions these diseases will spread and affect other fishes.
So quick diagnosis, accurate detection and precautionary measures should be taken.
Our project harnesses the power of Deep learning and build easy to use application to detect fish
diseases early and accurately.
